#### Questions to Answer
Please provide answers to these questions using markdown notation and place them in the `\0-Warmup` directory in your git repository:

1. Select with an `x` the platform you will be using for your course deliverables:

    - [x ] drexel's tux cluster
    - [ ] WSL on Windows
    - [ ] Orbstack on MacOs
    - [ ] VMWare Fusion
    - [ ] Somthing else (put name here)

2. I have installed my virtual machine, tested it, feel comfortable using it, and validated that the required software is installed:

    - [ ] YES
    - [x ] N/A - I plan to use tux
    - [ ] NO - Not Yet


3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class. 

Here's a link: https://github.com/PW13052003/CS283---Course-Assignments

4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

This class is unique in the sense that it isn't only about coding or building software. So diving into the low level programming is going to be interesting. I don't really know what to expect since I do not have experience in this field but I am curious to know what's in store nonetheless.

5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

I have not used C in a long while so I need to brush up on concepts in order to be able to write code in this class. Since I don't have prior experience with low level programming, I might find it challenging. I have not taken CS281 before so I hope that I wouldn't be at a significant disadvantage.
